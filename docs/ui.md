# UI Guidelines for the Chrome Extension

## Overview
This document describes the guideline for the visual interface for the project.

## Guideline
Design the UI in an organic flow style with soft, fluid, asymmetrical shapes and wavy curves instead of rigid corners or straight lines. Use gradients inspired by natural elements (oceans, plants, landscapes) with seamless blends rather than sharp contrasts. Typography should be rounded, friendly, and approachable (e.g., Nunito, Quicksand). Buttons should feature smooth curves, rounded corners, and gentle hover animations such as soft scaling or color blending. Backgrounds should use extremely light tones of blue, grey, and orange, layered with subtle organic patterns or gradients. Cards and containers should flow with curved edges and softly blended layers, avoiding rigid grids. Header and footer should use flowing, asymmetrical shapes or gently curved bars, blending naturally with the rest of the layout. The overall aesthetic must feel natural, warm, and fluid, prioritizing seamless harmony over contrast.
